(“MoneyGram”, “we” or “us”) through a network of agents, authorized delegates, or other permitted entities (“Agents”).These Terms and Conditions, along with the Documentation (as defined in Section 1.3) used in connection with the Service to which these Terms and Conditions may be included or attached, constitute the entire agreement (“Agreement”) between MoneyGram and you, the individual recipient of the Service (“you” or “Receiver”).
  p 1.2. Agreement and the Service allow you to receive a money transfer (a “Transfer” ) that has been sent using our Service from an individual (“Sender”). The Transfer has been sent to you in a currency and amount specifically designated by the Sender. MoneyGram will not charge you any fees for receiving the Transfer. The Service is available to you only in your individual capacity known to the Sender.
  p 1.3. You must sign this Agreement and any other documentation related to the Transfer, including all forms, receipts, or acknowledgments (collectively, the “Documentation”) fully and accurately in order to use the Service.
  p 1.4.

To the extent you desire to exchange the Transfer into a currency other than the currency as described in this Agreement, you further acknowledge and agree that any subsequent exchange of the Transfer is a separate transaction from the Service and is subject to the provisions of Section 6 of this Agreement
  p 1.5.   You must provide the Agent with valid identification to receive the Transfer. We will not have any liability in the event that the Transfer is disbursed, when and as applicable, to an individual who provides valid identification to the Agent describing such person as the Receiver (even if such identification was false or forged) and provides a Reference Number.
